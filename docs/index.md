## Summary 
Today, Iâ€™m going to explain how to test the RICOH THETA X model using the free mobile app [HTTP Request Shortcuts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.rmy.android.http_shortcuts) and the paid mobile app [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&hl=en_US&gl=US) for $3.49. With this combination you are able to take pictures and configure camera settings in the field with a custom workflow using an Android phone or tablet where you may be putting the camera in a car with one hand and holding the phone in your other hand. Similar apps are also available for iOS.

This may be an easy way to prototype workflows specific to the industry you are working in, before doing final development on your app.

To send HTTP Requests with HTTP Request Shortcuts I followed this article [Using the THETA Web API without programming (Remote photo app)](https://community.theta360.guide/t/using-the-theta-web-api-without-programming-remote-photo-app/4796) and if you need further information to reference I have an article testing the RICOH THETA Web API with HTTP Requests Shortcuts here [Testing RICOH THETA Web API via Android Mobile App](https://community.theta360.guide/t/testing-ricoh-theta-web-api-via-android-mobile-app/8797).

Tasker is going to be used to execute a set of API commands automatically from HTTP Request Shortcuts and group them together so we can organize a set of custom API requests into one group and press one button to set them off sequentially. We can also set that group of commands from tasker into a home screen shortcut!
